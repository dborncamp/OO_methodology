To run this you need to update the `InventoryFile` and `MenuFile` variables to look in the correct path for the
basic inventory and basic menu files. These files contain the initial menu and inventory of the system and the
program will fail without being able to read those files in.

There is a Driver class that shows some functionality, but not all. I am not sure how far I need to develop the
testing of the system with  the driver class to get full credit.
